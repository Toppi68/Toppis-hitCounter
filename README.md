## Overlay for game streamers


QUICKSTART:
Just open the index.html in your fav. browser. All your gamedata like runs, splits, pb's is autom. saved in the local browser storage.

NOTICE for local use
The gamedata is save, solong you start the counter from the same origin, folder (i.e. desktop). If you move the counter-folder, your existing gamedata will be lost - starts from zero again.
